Dymo

https://github.com/migurski/Dymo/blob/master/README.md

Dymo is a placement script for map labels, isolated from the purpose-built code in GeoIQ’s Acetate. Dymo resolves positions for densely-packed point labels, and results in layouts make your maps look like they’ve been touched by a cartographer.

Dymo uses Simulated Annealing to derive an acceptable global label set, described in Steven Wouderberg’s October 2007 presentation at Utrecht University. See an animation of the process over time in these two videos of U.S. and European place names:
