ShareMap-dymo-js
================

ShareMap-dymo-js is a port of Dymo (https://github.com/migurski/Dymo)  Python library created by Mike Migurski to JavaScript / ActionScript 3. 

The library is intended to be runnable in 4 enviroments:
* Browser client side
* Node.js server side
* Flash/AIR client side / mobile
* Rhino server side (inside Java code)

Right now the the best test enviroment are first two one but the latter two are also developed and benchmark will be published soon.

In the later plans this library will be enabled to be flawlessly integrated with D3 and LeafLet.

Very big help for Hugo Lopez from WikiMedia Atlas for guiding us into Dymo.

This project is conducted under ShareMap umbrella.
